# Rock, Paper, Scissors & Lizard, Spock (Node.js)

#User Story:
As a frequent game player, I’d like to play rock, paper, scissors
So that I can spend some hour of my day having fun.

#Objective
● I should be able to play Player vs Computer.
● I should be able to play Computer vs Computer.
● Each new game should be a different game.
● The game is a command line application.
- Front
  FE will be created in react js using new features but for now it is a static html page.
  In future will enhance into react using state and redux. 
#Acceptance Criteria:

  - Can I play Player vs Computer?
  - Can I play Computer vs Computer?
  - Can I play a different game each time?

- Back End

  Technical Constraints:

  - Doesn't necessarly need a flashy GUI (can be simple)
  - Use <s>PHP</s> _(Scala or Javascript)_
  - Libs / external modules should only be used for tests
  - Using best in industry agile engineering practices

Best if we use TDD, code coverage, copy and paste detection, designs (DDD, or design patterns).
So, i tried to use my "code-sens" to doing my best in less than one day, starting from scratch.
You will find here, an example of TDD, with a lot of tests.
